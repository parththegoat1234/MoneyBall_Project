⚾ Moneyball Project: Uncovering Baseball's Hidden Gems
Overview 🌟
This project dives into the fascinating world of baseball analytics, centering around the Moneyball methodology. By leveraging data, we identify undervalued players and craft strategies for building a competitive team. Through data analysis, machine learning, and cluster analysis, we reveal valuable insights into player performance, team dynamics, and salary trends.

📚 Notebooks
Moneyball_Project_Section_1.ipynb: An introduction to baseball fundamentals, exploring team-level statistics and their correlation with team success.
Moneyball_Project_Section_2.ipynb: A deep dive into individual player performance, focusing on batting statistics and salary prediction.
Moneyball_Project_Section_3.ipynb: Player clustering based on fielding, pitching, and batting data, identifying similar players and potential replacements.
📂 Project Structure
The project comprises three Jupyter Notebooks, each building upon the previous one to deliver a comprehensive analysis.
