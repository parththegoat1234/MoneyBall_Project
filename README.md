# **⚾ MoneyBall Project: Uncovering Baseball's Hidden Gems**
**Note: Based On A True Story And Movie Called [Moneyball]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)))**



## **Overview 🌟**
This project delves into the world of baseball analytics, applying the Moneyball methodology to identify undervalued players and build competitive teams. Through data analysis, machine learning, and clustering techniques, the project uncovers insights into player performance, team dynamics, and salary trends.
## **📚 Notebooks**
• **Moneyball_Project_Section_1.ipynb**: Introduction to baseball fundamentals, exploring team-level statistics and their correlation with success.

• **Moneyball_Project_Section_2.ipynb**: In-depth analysis of individual player performance, focusing on batting statistics and salary prediction.

• **Moneyball_Project_Section_3.ipynb**: Player clustering based on fielding, pitching, and batting data to identify similar players and potential replacements.
## 📂 **Project Structure**
The project includes three Google Notebooks, each building on the previous one to provide a comprehensive analysis.
## **🚀 Getting Started**
1. **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/moneyball-project.git

2. **Set up the environment:** Install the necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib).

3. **Run notebooks**: Execute the Google Notebooks sequentially to follow the analysis.

## **📊 Data**
The project utilizes baseball datasets containing player statistics, salaries, and team performance information.

**Data Source**: Collected from [**MLB Glossary**](https://www.mlb.com/glossary)




## **🛠 Methodology**
• **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalizing data, and creating relevant features.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and trends.

• **Machine Learning:** Applying models like linear regression and clustering for predictive analysis and player segmentation.

• **Cluster Analysis:** Identifying player groups based on similar characteristics for team-building strategies.
## **🎯 Results and Insights**
**Key Findings:**

• The cluster analysis using the **K Nearest Neighbors model** successfully identified similar players based on chosen features. This analysis highlighted how different player attributes influence their similarity, providing a deeper understanding of player roles and potential replacements.


**Potential Applications:**

• The insights from the cluster analysis can be used to identify undervalued players with similar attributes to top performers, aiding in strategic team-building decisions and optimizing player selection.
## **🔮 Future Work**
• **Enhancing Model Performance:** Explore advanced machine learning techniques and feature engineering.

• **Expanding The Dataset(s):** Incorporate additional data sources (e.g., scouting reports, player health metrics).

• **Real-Time Analysis:** Develop a system for processing and analyzing live game data.
